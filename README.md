### About Me

I am a software engineer with 5 years of experience in a proffesional role.
Day to day I generally work on maintiaining and updating calibration/service software for gas detectrors.

I graduated with a degree in "Games Computing", an egregious name for a course.
Most of the content was the same as a standard CS degree, with the added benefits of creating a few simple games and exploring game design concepts.
I also played a lot of games...I can't lie about that.
