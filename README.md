### About Me

I am a software engineer with 5 years of experience in a professional role.
Day to day I generally work on maintaining and updating calibration/service software for gas detectors.

I graduated with a degree in "Games Computing", an egregious name for a course.
Most of the content was the same as a standard CS degree, with the added benefits of creating a few simple games and exploring game design concepts.
I also played a lot of games...I can't lie about that.

My goal this year is to create some projects purely for myself regardless of how silly they might be. Programming purely for work is monotonous and kills any/all passion for the craft.
