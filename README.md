### About Me

I am a software engineer with ~3 years of experience in a proffesional role.
Day to day I generally work on maintiaining and updating calibration/service software for gas detectrors.

I graduated with a degree in "Games Computing", an egregious name for a course where I generally worked on programming simple games.
I also played a lot of games...I can't lie about that.

### GitHub Status

I recently decided to empty out my github and get rid of old projects.
This is in an effort to build a more up-to-date set of projects demonstrating where my skillset lies.
